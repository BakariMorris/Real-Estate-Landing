# Real Estate Landing Page - High-Converting Lead Generation Platform

## Project Overview
A high-performance real estate landing page designed to achieve 8-12% conversion rates (above industry average of 7.4%) through strategic UX design, mobile-first optimization, and proven lead generation tactics. The platform focuses on capturing qualified real estate leads through compelling value propositions, minimal friction forms, and trust-building elements.

# Critical Development Rules:

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:**
- **NO Development Mode Handling**: Never implement development mode fallbacks, simulations, or mock data
- **NO Data Simulation**: Never simulate, mock, or fake data when encountering errors
- **NO Fallback Authentication**: Never bypass authentication or create development-only user accounts
- **NO Environment-Specific Code Paths**: All code must work identically across environments
- **NO Generic Content**: Never use placeholder or template content - all copy must be compelling and conversion-focused

**Required Approach:**
- Read errors thoroughly and implement proper fixes
- Use real services and databases only
- Enforce proper form validation and data handling always  
- If a service is unavailable, the application should fail gracefully with proper error messages
- All code changes must allow TypeScript to build without any errors. ABSOLUTELY NO ERRORS ARE ALLOWED
- Focus on conversion optimization and lead quality over feature quantity
